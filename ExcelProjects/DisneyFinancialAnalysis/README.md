# Disney Financial Analysis

## Introduction 
With recent reports of Disney having poor financials, as well as layoffs of high profile employees, I wanted to take a deeper look into the finances of the company of the last four years to see what could be the problem and how to fix it.

## Installation
To start, you would need to access the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) by obtaining an API. The API is featured within the Python file. To access the various financial statements, you would need to import pandas and requests to be able to pull the balance sheet, income statement, stock data, and cash flow statement. https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/

## Business Problem
For this project, we want to see what could be the result of the company losing money to the point of large scale layoffs. We will take a look at the financial statements to see what can be improved. This data does not specific segments of revenue or expenses so we will speculate as to what those will be.

## Analysis Steps:
    1. Imported pandas and requests in Python
    2. Use API from FMP to pull Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, and stock data
    3. Created separate csv files for each dataset and combined them into one notebook
    4. Cleaned data by correcting number format, orgnazing data in more readable format
    5. Calcuated ratios such as P/E, Current, Net Profit and Quick
    6. Visulazied data with various chart types and listed in dashboard
    
## Results
Based on the analysis of the past five years, revenue has been steady, however expenses are signficantly higher than gross profit, including declining profiablity ratios. Additionally, operating cash flow has declined during that span, starting in 2020. This could be from the COVID-19 pandemic causing theme park closures and movies that were supposed to come out in theatres having to be released later or on Disney+. 


## Conclusion to Improve Financials
To put the company into a status of increasing revenue, the following changes should be made = not including the layoffs that have already taken place:

  1. Theme park revenue will increase as people are traveling again since the pandemic
  2. Lower the budget of theatrical release movies such as reboots or remakes. This should help overall expenses and use what is leftover to pay actor salaries
  3. Offer pricing tiers for streaming services, allowing advertisers to pay for slots to be featured in commercials on the free tier of Disney+ or ESPN+, then raise the prices for ad-free viewing for consumers

Overall, the company is still doing well based on revenue, but the previously suggested changes should help the comapny get back on track.
