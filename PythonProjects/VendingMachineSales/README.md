# Vending Machine Sales with Python


## Introduction with Business Problem

Fast Snacks had some concerns based on their delivery workers stating that they kept stocking the same products week after week at each location. Management then approached a data consulting company to see if they can help better track how many producs they sell at each location so they can determine what sells and what does not.

This project analyzes sales data from Fast Snacks (vending machine company) to identify trends, popular products, and ways to improve sales for next year.
